# Scope Document: CMPA 3301 Resource Repository

## Project Overview
The **CMPA 3301 Resource Repository** is a professional-grade web environment designed to serve as both a central hub for course materials and a functional demonstration of web development best practices. This project bridges the gap between theoretical computing concepts and practical application.

## Project Objectives
* **Demonstration:** Showcase the "Separation of Concerns" using clean HTML, external CSS, and modular JavaScript.
* **Transparency:** Provide students with real-time data insights into cohort performance and discussion trends.
* **Accessibility:** Ensure all course resources are easily navigable and deployed via GitHub Pages for 24/7 access.

## Technical Scope

### 1. Front-End Architecture
* **Semantic HTML5:** Utilizing structural tags to ensure accessibility and SEO-friendly document outlines.
* **External Styling:** Managing all visual aesthetics through a centralized `style.css` to demonstrate scalable design.
* **Responsive Frameworks:** Implementation of Tailwind CSS for rapid, mobile-first dashboard layouts.

### 2. Data Visualization
* **Tooling:** Integration of **Chart.js** to transform raw discussion metrics into interactive visual components.
* **Analysis Logic:** Displaying synthesized data to help students understand the "Wicked" risk formula and professional behavioral trends.

### 3. Deployment & Version Control
* **Host:** GitHub Pages.
* **Workflow:** Utilizing Git for versioning, ensuring that the "live" site reflects the most current documentation and data.

## Deliverables
* `index.html`: The primary entry point and instructor introduction.
* `style.css`: The global stylesheet.
* `dashboards/`: A directory containing specific technical reports for Discussions 01 through 04.
* `README.md`: The repository guide (mapped from the main course input).

---

## Constraints & Out-of-Scope
* **Personal Data:** To maintain privacy, specific student names are excluded from analytics; data is presented in aggregate form only.
* **Learning Management:** This repository is a supplement to, not a replacement for, the official Canvas LMS. All formal assignments and grading must still occur within Canvas.
