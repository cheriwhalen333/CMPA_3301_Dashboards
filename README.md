## 📊 Course Performance Analytics

As part of our commitment to transparency and the **"Unofficial PM"** mindset, I provide interactive data dashboards for our major discussions. These visualizations help the cohort identify common technical trends, successes, and areas for improvement.

* **Interactive Course Dashboard:** A high-level overview of our 8-week roadmap, grading weights, and the "Monday-Wednesday-Sunday" rhythm.
* **Discussion 01 Analytics:** Performance breakdown for the "Student Introductions" forum.
* **Discussion 02 Analytics:** Analysis of the "Power of Range" and the regional outage waiver impact.
* **Discussion 03 Analytics:** Synthesis of our class insights on "Informal Authority" and professional behaviors.
* **Discussion 04 Analytics:** Review of how the cohort quantified "Wicked" risks using the formula:

$$Actual Risk = Impact \times Probability$$
